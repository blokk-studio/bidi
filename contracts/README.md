# Contract is work in progress

## What is covered?
- a simple and clean way to create a NFT via smart contract, in the Hedera way.
- as there is no way to send NFT to user wallets during mint (as it's possible in Eth), we are assigning the target wallet id upon mint. Later on, only the assigned wallet will be able to claim the NFT.

## What's needed?
- create BIDI fungible token and lock a certain amount on the NFT, upon minting. The contract will be re-deployed after that's done.

## Deploy the contract
To deploy the project as it is:
- to clear previous contract generations and artifacts ``pnpm run clear``
- to compile a fresh contract ``pnpm run compile``
- before deploying the contract, we have to make sure we added ``NFT_METADATA_URI`` in env variables as future NFT metadata will be saved under that folder. (https://pinata.cloud/ would be a nice place to start..)
- when everything is ready, run ``pnm run deploy`` and the contract will be deployed, and NFT collection created.
