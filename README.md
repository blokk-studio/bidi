# **What is BIDI?**

BIDI is a groundbreaking initiative that connects individuals, businesses, and conservation efforts.  Users earn NFTs (biodiversity certificates) by participating in verified conservation projects. These NFTs can be redeemed for BIDI tokens, which can be spent at local businesses, fostering a sustainable local economy.

Collaboration: Developed in partnership with the BIDI-Organisation, a real-world organization from Switzerland (https://www.bidigut.ch/) dedicated to promoting biodiversity in their environment. 

**Key Features**

* **Rewarding Conservation:** Earn NFTs and BIDI tokens for contributing to biodiversity projects.
* **Empowering Communities:** Spend BIDI tokens at local businesses, supporting your community and the environment.
* **Built on Hedera:** Leverages the security, transparency, and speed of the Hedera network.
* **NFT Certificates:**  Provides verifiable proof of participation in conservation efforts.
* **Sustainable Economy:** Creates a circular economy that benefits both people and the planet.
